# Word search game

This is another game I tried to make but this time only with React. It's not full of capabilities yet hopefully these can be added in time. You can play a fast game which uses built in words or a custom game with your own variable number of words and on a square grid of sizes between 4x4 and 12x12. You can also get hints by clicking on each word to highlight where the fist letter in the grid is located.

## Note

This React program uses classes instead of only objects. While this may not be idiomatic as React prefers plain objects instead of non-serialzable typesit certainly helped me keep code organized better , I think , than with only objects.
